# Google Cloud DNS Challenge Provider

The `gcloud` DNS challenge provider can be used to perform DNS challenges for
the [`acme_certificate`][resource-acme-certificate] resource with
[Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com).

For complete information on how to use this provider with the `acme_certifiate`
resource, see [here][resource-acme-certificate-dns-challenges].

## Example

resource "acme_certificate" "certificate" {
  ...

  dns_challenge {
    provider = "gcloud"
  }
}
```
## Argument Reference

The following arguments can be either passed as environment variables, or
directly through the `config` block in the
[`dns_challenge`][resource-acme-certificate-dns-challenge-arg] argument in the
